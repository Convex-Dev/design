# Governance

The Convex Network is governed by the **Convex Foundation**, a dedicated non-profit entity committed to fostering 
a secure, decentralised, and thriving ecosystem for global peer-to-peer value exchange. 
By prioritising community-driven principles, the Foundation ensures Convex remains innovative, accessible, 
and aligned with the vision of empowering developers and users worldwide.

The Foundation drives key initiatives on behalf of the ecosystem:

- **Ensures robust governance** of the Convex Network, safeguarding its integrity and long-term sustainability.
- **Operates key community resources** including the flagship [convex.world](https://convex.world) website and developer resources such as [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/Convex-Dev) and [Convex Docs](https://docs.convex.world)
- **Manages the initial issuance of Convex Coins (CVM)** to individuals, organizations, and ecosystem participants, overseeing a transparent release curve designed to promote fair distribution and network stability.
- **Rewards ecosystem contributors** through grants and awards, recognizing open-source developers, builders, and innovators who advance the platform.
- **Accelerates ecosystem development** via strategic partnerships, targeted marketing, educational programs, and community initiatives that inspire collaboration and real-world impact.

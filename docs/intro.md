# Convex Intro

Convex is a high-performance platform for decentralised applications. 

It delivers the true promise of Web3: flexibility and scalability far beyond the capabilities of traditional blockchains. In particular, it is supports high volume, interactive applications used directly by end users such as for mobile apps, payments and gaming.

# Key Advantages

- **Lightning fast consensus**: The unique Convergent Proof of Stake (CPoS) algorithm is decentralised, leaderless, byzantine fault tolerant, offers front-running resistance and reaches consensus in milliseconds. This is the ultimate solution for realtime, interactive decentralised systems.
- **True global state**: Convex delivers blazing fast performance while still giving a developers a consistent global state. No shards, cross-chain transactions, roll-ups or other complications.
- **Powerful virtual machine**: The CVM has proven to be capable of a million transactions per second. Based on the lambda calculus and providing powerful immutable persistent data structures, it represents the next generation of decentralised virtual machine technology.

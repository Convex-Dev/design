Convex actors are autonomous programs that hold state, expose callable functions, and participate in economic systems on-chain. This section introduces the concepts, tools, and best practices you need to build robust actors on the Convex Virtual Machine (CVM).

## What you'll learn

- How Convex actors map to familiar smart contract patterns.
- Deployment flows for moving code from development to production.
- Techniques for keeping contract-driven experiences responsive in real time.
- Best practices gathered from the Convex team and community for writing maintainable contracts.

## Where to start

Each subpage builds on the previous one, but you can jump directly to what you need:

- [Actor Concepts](./actor-concepts) — core ideas, anatomy, and lifecycle of Convex actors.
- [Deployment](./deployment) — packaging code, publishing actors, and managing upgrades safely.
- [Evolution](./evolution) — strategies for real-time collaboration with data lattice and subscriptions.
- [Best Practices](./best-practices) — practical advice and checklists from production projects.

Dive in to master Convex contracts end-to-end.

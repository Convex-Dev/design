# Recipes

This section contains a bunch of ready-to-cook examples.

Recipes involve some basic code commands, but should be accessible to non-developers - so don't be afraid to try them out with if you are new to coding and/or just want to learn!

Many of these examples demonstrate our principle of "One Line DeFi" - the idea that most significant on-chain economic transactions should be possible with a simple 1-line command with no advanced coding or new smart contracts required.

Convex offers a comprehensive, full-stack solution for building decentralised applications (dApps) and open economic systems.

## Core Concepts

### Convex Coins

Learn about the native currency and accounts:
- **[Convex Coins](coins)** - Native utility token (CVM)
- **[Faucet Guide](coins/faucet)** - Getting test funds

### Smart Contracts

Build on-chain logic with Convex:
- **[Convex Lisp](convex-lisp)** - The on-chain programming language
- **[Actors](actors)** - Smart contracts and autonomous actors
- **[Recipes](recipes)** - Practical how-to guides

### Network Operations

Run and operate peer infrastructure:
- **[Peer Operations](peer-operations)** - Complete operations guide
- **[Local Testnets](peer-operations/local-testnets)** - Development environments

## Learning Paths

Choose your path based on what you want to build:

### 🚀 Application Developer

**Build apps that use Convex for state and transactions**

1. Start with [Networks](networks) - Understand available networks
2. Choose your [SDK](client-sdks) - Pick your programming language
3. Follow SDK quickstart - Get your first transaction working
4. Explore [Recipes](recipes) - Practical examples

**Best for:** Web apps, mobile apps, backend services

---

### 📜 Smart Contract Developer

**Build autonomous actors and on-chain logic**

1. Learn [Convex Lisp](convex-lisp) - Master the on-chain language
2. Understand [Actors](actors) - Smart contract concepts
3. Study [Recipes](recipes) - Working examples
4. Test with [Local Peer](peer-operations/local-testnets) - Fast iteration

**Best for:** DeFi protocols, DAOs, on-chain logic

---

### 🖥️ Peer Operator

**Run peer infrastructure and participate in consensus**

1. Read [Networks](networks) - Understand network architecture
2. Study [Peer Staking](peer-operations/staking) - Economic requirements
3. Choose [Deployment Method](peer-operations/manual-deployment) - Set up infrastructure
4. Follow [Security Guide](peer-operations/security) - Secure operations

**Best for:** Infrastructure providers, validators, high-availability operations

## Getting Started

### Networks

Learn about Convex networks and how to connect to them:

- **[Networks Guide](networks)** - Understand network types, find available networks
  - Production networks (peer.convex.live)
  - Public testnets (with faucets)
  - Local development peers

### Client SDKs

Connect to Convex from your application using official client libraries:

- **[TypeScript](/docs/tutorial/client-sdks/typescript)** - For web apps, Node.js, Deno, React applications with full type safety
  *Production ready* • `npm install @convex-world/convex-ts`

- **[JavaScript](/docs/tutorial/client-sdks/javascript)** - Plain JavaScript (no TypeScript required)
  *Production ready* • Idiomatic JS examples

- **[Java](/docs/tutorial/client-sdks/java)** - For JVM applications, Android, enterprise systems
  *Production ready* • `world.convex:convex-java:0.8.2`

- **[Python](/docs/tutorial/client-sdks/python)** - For Python applications, scripting, data science
  *Production ready* • `pip install convex-api`

- **Rust** *(Coming soon)* - For Rust applications

For command-line interaction, see the [Convex CLI](/docs/products/convex-cli).

# Convex Architecture Documents

## Overview

Convex CADs are open standard specifications for Convex and related tools.

CADs can be proposed and developed by the community, and are available on GitHub to allow easy open sopurce contributions.

In the spirit of Internet RFCs, CADs formalise standards that can be shared throughout the ecosystem and benefit the broader community through compatibility and interoperability. There SHOULD be a CAD for any functionality that is intended to be an open protocol or interface for others to build upon.

## Governance

Updates to CADs are governed by the Convex Foundation, which will make decisions on CAD updates and offiocal acceptance in the interests of the broader Convex ecosystem.

Contributions and proposals for new CADs are welcome.

# Convex Architecture Documents

## Overview

Convex CADs (Convex Architecture Documents) are open, community-driven specifications that define the core functionality and interoperability of Convex and related tools. They serve as a blueprint for developers to create compatible and interoperable applications within the Convex ecosystem.

Anyone can propose and develop a CAD, and all CADs are openly available on GitHub to encourage community contributions and transparency. Similar to the Internet RFC process, CADs formalize standards that can be adopted and shared throughout the Convex ecosystem, promoting compatibility and interoperability.

## Governance

The Convex Foundation oversees the governance of CADs, making decisions on updates and official acceptance to maintain the integrity and compatibility of the Convex ecosystem. While the Foundation plays a crucial role, the community is encouraged to contribute and propose new CADs. This collaborative approach ensures that the standards evolve in line with the needs and innovations of the Convex community.

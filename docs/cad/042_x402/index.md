# CAD042: x402 Protocol

## Overview

This CAD describes the Convex implementation of the [x402 protocol](https://www.x402.org/), an open protocol for internet-native payments built around the HTTP 402 status code.

x402 enables users to pay for resources via API without registration, emails, OAuth, or complex signatures. The protocol activates the dormant HTTP 402 status code and works with any HTTP stack through headers and status codes.

:::note
This CAD is currently under development. We implementing the x402 protocol for Convex, which will enable frictionless micropayments and payment-gated API access using Convex's native payment infrastructure, with support for CVM and any CAD29 fungible tokens.

Snapshots of the `convex.jar` file are currently available here: [Convex Snapshots](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AZdyuZOmC70i_TtuEW3uEKvjYLOqIMiv?usp=sharing)

## Running Convex Desktop

If Java is correctly configured, you should be able to run Convex Desktop simply by double-clicking on the `convex.jar` file which will run Convex Desktop as an executable. On some systems, you may need to grant permissions to run a downloaded executable file.

Alternatively to run Convex Desktop, you can run the following commend from the command prompt, script or GUI shortcut:

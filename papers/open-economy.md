# Thoughts on Open Economic Systems

In which some relevant ideas an maximising value are noted.

## On Economics

1. Economics is the study of choice
1. Economic actors make decisions and take decisions based on preferences
1. Value is, ultimately, a measure of how preferences are satisfied
1. Value exchange is when two or more agents choose to interact
1. Both parties can gain from this exchange (fish vs. bread)
1. A barter system can exist purely on the basis of mutual exchange
1. Barter systems break down at scale - double coincidence of wants is hard to find as economies grow in complexity

## On Money

1. Money is debt - an obligation to provide some future benefit
	- Apples to fiat money, commodity backed money, private money, utility tokens
	- UK money "I promise to pay the bearer on demand"
1. Some inherent risk in money
	- Default / credit risk
	- Is the promise worth anything?
1. Solves double coincidence of wants if widely accepted

## On Equity

1. Law of diminishing marginal utility 
	- A pound in the hand of someone relatively poor does more good than in the hands of a billionaire
	- In line with natural intuition, this suggest a more equal income distribution is better
1. Hard to compare value across individuals:
	- Rawlsian approach is maximin (only thing that matters is the utility of the poorest) - but this means that the average can still be just as bad and there is no ethical value in improving the average at all
	- Maximum expected utility could imply equal income distribution is optimal - but only if the total wealth was fixed, everyone had same weight and utility curves and everyone had the same preferences. Not realistic!
	- Incentives: If you want to maximise overall wealth, it requires individual to choose to put in effort, and this requires an income gradient assuming effort is otherwise costly
	- Free choice means that people will choose trade-offs differently (e.g. income vs leisure vs family). This is OK!
1. Balanced conclusion: we should redistribute to maximise expected utility, which means a mix of redistribution and incentives
1. Sources of wealth:
	- Luck (e.g. born in an advanced economy, good genetics)
	- Effort (paid work, study, entrepreneurship)
	- Theft
1. Only effort is virtuous and deserves reward
	- Note: talent is combination of luck (born with it or in a position to gain it) and effort (worked to develop skills)
1. Conclusion: average person only "deserves" a fraction of their market rate income
	- Hard to distinguish luck and effort: reasonable assumption is everyone has mix, more luck dependent at extremes

## Theft

1. Definition: obtaining value, at the expense of others, without consent
2. Broader than legal definition:
	- Pollution is theft (degrading the commons, imposing clean up or health costs)
	- Monopolies are theft (structurally extracting value from consumers via high prices, and suppliers with lower prices)
	- Land ownership is (potentially) theft (Georgist view) - restricting others from the use of common land
3. Theft might be justified in many cases
	- e.g. some amount of pollution might be optimal if benefits are high
	- However: compensatory value must be paid (e.g. Pigouvian tax)
	
## Transaction Costs

1. Many forms of transaction costs:
	- Financial settlement / payment fees
	- Search costs
	- Administration costs
	- Regulatory costs
1. Transaction costs destroy value to both producers and consumers
1. Transaction costs furthermore have negative externalities
	- Reduce competition
1. A good economy should minimise transaction costs are far as possible

## The Fair Economy

1. Objective: Price == True Cost
	- When you buy anything, you pay the full cost of its production, no more or less
	- True cost includes fairly compensating those who provide the goods or services (workers, entrepreneurs etc.)
	- True cost implies transaction costs and waste minimised as far as feasible
	- Profit is value creation if and only if Price == True cost
1. All individuals are free to participate in the economy
	- May earn income for labour
	- May create value through entrepreneurship (profit from buying / selling)
1. Golden Rule in general:
	- "Do unto others", tradition in many religions
	- Freedom to do what you like providing it doesn't harm others
1. Reasonable marginal rates of tax on income are fair
	- Reflects fact that most income comes from being part of an advanced civilisation
	- Reflects fact that a proportion of income is also luck (and potentially theft...)
	- Implication: means tested benefits with high marginal rates of withdrawal are unfair
1. A Universal Basic Income is fair
	- Dividend from shared civilisational capital
	- Recognises burdens imposed by society and compensates for these
	- Recognises individuals creating value outside market system (e.g. carers)
	- Most efficient way to achieve redistribution that maximises expected utility
1. Land Value Tax is fair
1. Taxes on negative externalities are fair
	- Large component of true cost (otherwise: polluters can profit while massively destroying value)
1. Taxes utilised for legitimate purposes
	- Redistribution via UBI
	- Universal public services, especially where cannot be market provided e.g. natural monopolies, information asymmetry.
	- Security and protection of rights
	- Justice
	- Fair governance

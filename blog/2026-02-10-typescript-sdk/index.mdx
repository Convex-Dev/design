We're excited to announce the official **TypeScript SDK** for Convex! Build web applications, Node.js services, and React dApps with full type safety and modern JavaScript tooling.

<!-- truncate -->

## What is convex.ts?

The `@convex-world/convex-ts` package is a production-ready TypeScript client library that provides a clean, modern API for interacting with the Convex decentralised lattice network. Whether you're building a web app, backend service, or React dApp, this SDK has you covered.

```bash
npm install @convex-world/convex-ts
```

## Key Features

### 🔍 Read-Only Queries

Query the Convex network without needing an account or keys:

```typescript
import { Convex } from '@convex-world/convex-ts';

const convex = new Convex('https://peer.convex.live');
const result = await convex.query('(balance #13)');
console.log('Balance:', result.value);
```

### 🔐 Full Account Support

Use your existing Convex account with Ed25519 key pairs:

```typescript
import { KeyPair } from '@convex-world/convex-ts';

const keyPair = KeyPair.fromSeed(yourSeed);
convex.setAccount('#1678', keyPair);

// Query your balance
const info = await convex.getAccountInfo();
console.log('Balance:', info.balance / 1_000_000_000, 'Convex Coins');

// Transfer coins
await convex.transfer('#456', 1_000_000_000);
```

### 🔌 Pluggable Signers

Extensible signer interface for hardware wallets, browser extensions, and HSM:

```typescript
class HardwareWalletSigner implements Signer {
  getPublicKey(): Uint8Array {
    return this.cachedPublicKey;
  }

  async sign(message: Uint8Array): Promise<Uint8Array> {
    // Prompts user on hardware device
    return await this.wallet.signMessage(message);
  }
}

convex.setSigner(new HardwareWalletSigner(wallet));
```

### 📘 Full TypeScript Support

Complete type definitions for IntelliSense and compile-time checking:

```typescript
import type { TransactionResult, AccountInfo } from '@convex-world/convex-ts';

const result: TransactionResult = await convex.transfer('#456', 1_000_000_000);

if (result.status === 'success') {
  console.log('Transaction hash:', result.hash);
}
```

### 🌐 Environment Agnostic

Works everywhere JavaScript runs - **zero DOM dependencies**:

- ✅ **Node.js** - Backend services and scripts
- ✅ **Browsers** - Web applications
- ✅ **Deno** - Modern JavaScript runtime
- ✅ **Bun** - Fast all-in-one toolkit

### ⚛️ React Integration

Hooks and components coming soon via `@convex-world/convex-react`:

```typescript
// Coming soon!
import { useConvexQuery } from '@convex-world/convex-react';

function Balance({ address }) {
  const { data, loading } = useConvexQuery(`(balance ${address})`);
  return <div>Balance: {data?.value}</div>;
}
```

## Why TypeScript?

The Convex network is powered by the Java-based Convex Virtual Machine (CVM), but we know that modern web developers live in the JavaScript ecosystem. The TypeScript SDK bridges this gap, providing:

- **Modern ESM** - Native ES modules with proper `import` statements
- **Type Safety** - Catch errors at compile time, not runtime
- **IntelliSense** - Full autocomplete in VS Code and other editors
- **Zero Config** - Works out of the box with modern tools
- **Future-Proof** - Built on web standards

## JavaScript Too!

Don't use TypeScript? No problem! The SDK works perfectly with plain JavaScript. We've created a [dedicated JavaScript guide](/docs/tutorial/client-sdks/javascript) with idiomatic examples:

```javascript
// Plain JavaScript - no TypeScript required!
import { Convex } from '@convex-world/convex-ts';

const convex = new Convex('https://peer.convex.live');
const result = await convex.query('(balance #13)');
console.log('Balance:', result.value);
```

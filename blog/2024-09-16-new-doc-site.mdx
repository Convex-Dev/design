After a few days of hacking we've finally got our new documentation site up and running! Every great project needs great docs, and we're using a powerful tool to make this happen: [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)

What's great about this?
- Everyone in the community can now easily [contribute documentation](https://github.com/Convex-Dev/design) though the GitHub `design` repository
- The docs site includes the [CADs](/docs/cad/0000cads) which formally define Convex APIs, protocols and other key specifications
- It's a much needed centralised resource for the Convex ecosystem as we launch Protonet

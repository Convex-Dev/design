# Metadata

## Overview

The CVM provides a powerful facility for attaching a metadata map to a defined symbol. The purpose of metadata is to provide any information on a defined symbol regardless of the
concrete value this symbol holds.

Some metadata information, if specified, MUST follow a particular structure for external purposes. For instance, this CAD describes how to document a symbol by following an
expected structure.

Other information CAN follow any arbitrary structure.

## Usage

### Declaring metadata

Metadata is a map containing any arbitrary set of key-values. It is specified after the defined symbol, prefixed with `^`:

```clojure
(def some-symbol

  ^{:my ["meta" :data]}

  42)
```

### Retrieving metadata

The core library defines a function for retrieving metadata:

```clojure
(lookup-meta 'some-symbol)

;; Following previous example, returns `{:my ["meta" :data]}`
```

Each account stores a map of `symbol` to `metadata map` under `:metadata`:

```clojure
(get (account *address*)
     :metadata)

;; Following previous examples, returns `{'some-symbol {:my ["meta" :data]}}`
```

## Standard structures

For some purposes, metadata must follow at least a set of contraints so that the CVM or any external consumer has access to relevant information.

### Documentation

Attaching documentation to a symbol allows any user to gain insight about the purpose of that symbol. Notably, it can provide information regarding how a function is
intended to be used and why.

User MAY specify any information as described below. None is mandatory. When specified, structure MUST conform as expected by any external consumer.

A documentation map MAY be attached to metadata under `:doc`.

Reference example:

```clojure
(defn add

  ^{:doc {:description "Adds 2 numbers together."
          :errors      {:CAST "If an argument cannot be cast to a number"}
          :examples    [{:code "(add 2 3)"}]
          :signature   [{:params  [a b]
                         :returns Number}]
          :type        :function}}

  :implementation...)
```

Documentation map MAY contain any of the key-values described in the following subsections.

#### `:description`

String describing the symbol in human language .

TODO. Also a vector of strings where each string is a paragraph for easier formatting?

#### `:errors`

Assuming the symbol is callable, map of `error code` to `string` describing in human language how and why calling this function might fail.

See also [CAD 011](../011_errors) about errors.

#### `:examples`

Assuming the symbol is callable, vector of examples where an example is a map which MAY contain:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `:code` | String, excerpt of code demonstrating a function call |

TODO. Should it be a string? Is it for memory issues?
TODO. Should it also have a `:return` key-value?

#### `:signature`

Assuming the symbol is callable, vector of signatures where a signature is a map which MAY contain:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `:params` | Vector of parameters |
| `:returns` | Type of returned value |

TODO. Is there a list of supported types for `:returns`? More future-proof to have a human-readable string?

#### `:type`

Keyword designating what category the symbol belongs to:

| Keyword | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `:function` | Symbol is a regular function |
| `:macro` | Symbol is a macro |

TODO. What about other values?

### Expanders

As described in [CAD 009](../009_expanders/README.md), expanders MUST have at least `{:expander true}` in their metadata.

TODO. Use `:expander?` for consistency.

TODO. Example here? Or rather in CAD009?


TODO. Other sections besides documentation and expanders?
